# Abalone Age Prediction Project

This project involves predicting the age of abalones based on various physical measurements using machine learning regression techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the number of rings in an abalone, which is indicative of its age. The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Uci Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone).
 

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to understand the dataset's characteristics.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., 'Sex') using LabelEncoder.
  - Splitting the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
  - Normalizing features using StandardScaler.

- **Model Building**:
  - Utilizing various regression models:
    - Linear Regression
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - (Optional: Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Polynomial Regression)

- **Evaluation**:
  - Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
